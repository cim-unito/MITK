Fiber extraction:
Place ROIs in the 2D render widgets (cricles or polygons) and extract fibers from the bundle that pass through these ROIs by selecting the according ROI and fiber bundle in the datamanger and starting the extraction. The ROIs can be combined via logical operations. All fibers that pass through the thus generated composite ROI are extracted. This can also be done using 3D ROIs represented as closed surface meshes.

\li Tract density image: generate a 2D heatmap from a fiber bundle
\li Binary envelope: generate a binary image from a fiber bundle
\li Fiber bundle image: generate a 2D rgba image representation of the fiber bundle
\li Fiber endings image: generate a 2D binary image showing the locations of fiber endpoints
\li Fiber endings pointset: generate a poinset containing the locations of fiber endpoints

The selected fiber bundle can be smoothed by interpolating the fiber points using Kochanek splines with the specified number of points per cm. 
If a float image with pixel values between 0 and 1 is selcted, the fiber bundle can be colored according to the pixel values.
